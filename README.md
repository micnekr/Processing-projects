# Processing projects

## This is a very old repository and the code quality in some of the projects is not great

A collection of projects I was coding along [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) to learn processing, [a java framework](https://processing.org/).

Most of the projects were heavily inspired by [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain), but some of them are original.
